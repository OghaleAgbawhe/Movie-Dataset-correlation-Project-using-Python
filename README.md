# Movie-Dataset-correlation-Project-using-Python

Data source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)

Python environment: Written via Jupyter notebook

Libraries utilized: This project involved the use of libraries such as pandas, seaborn and matplotlib

Below is a summary of the steps undertaken in this project:

# 1 - Reading in the data 

The downloaded Kaggle dataset was read in as a dataframe

# 2 - Checking for missing data 

This was accomplished using a for loop

There are multiple approaches to handling missing data. In this situation, I opted to simply remove the data that was missing from the dataset. This method is straightforward, but it carries the potential of introducing bias into the results.

# 3 - Modifying data types

Understanding the data types

Modifying numerical variables of interest - budget and gross revenue. Converting it to integers to eliminate the decimals

# 4 - Correlation analysis 

Investigating the correlations between budget, company, votes and gross revenue. Checking to see the relationship between each of the three 
aforementioned variables and the gross revenue.

#Relationship between a movie's budget and its gross revenue

A scatter plot was used to investigate this

Creating a heatmap to obtain the correlation matrix for all numerical variables

# Does a movie's budget influence its gross revenue?
From the heatmap, we see that the relationship between a movieâ€™s budget and its gross revenue is quite strong. It has the highest Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.74.

# Is there a relationship between votes and gross revenue?
Checking to see if the user votes (IMDB votes) are also related to gross revenue. We see that there is a relationship as evidenced with the correlation coefficient of 0.61

# Is there a relationship between the company and gross revenue?

Plotting the correlation matrix again - for all numeric features. Here, the categorical variables have been transformed to numerics for analysis

With a correlation of 0.12, it can be observed that there is little to no relationship between the company and a movie's gross revenue.
